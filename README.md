# CHECKERS GAME
Program simulating the game of checkers, implemented in Java.

To print the board on the screen I've used UTF-8 encoded characters in the form of filled and hollow circles.
If the encoding doesn't correspond on the machine you test the code, please subtitute the characters with "1" and "2" in the showBoard() method.
There are some comments placed where the change would be performed.
Alternatively, for a better look, you could paste the characters from this file ("●" and "○").
